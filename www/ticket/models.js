Additionally we will discuss what the impact of not complying with duties could be - including civil penalties and revocation of licences. We will provide a full examining of the compliance duties, the effects of non-compliance, and the consequences of not following the correct regulations.

    description:"A Graphic Design Course. To learn design you have to design. The connecting threat of the course is the execution of different graphic design projects and the subsequent collective analysis. Thus, the student will develop their creative and analytical capacities. And at the end of the course will have a portfolio much more worthy than a rÃ©sumÃ©. This does not mean that the theory is shelved. On the contrary, it will deepen in the history of art and thought, and, of course, in the disciplines of graphic design.  Talk about concept, composition, typography, identity, editorial design, signage.  There will be a final project in which each student will design their own corporate identity.",

We will walk you through the process of printing a 3D Modell on one of our I3 Berlin Printers. Furthermore you will get an overview of the 3d printing technology, the latest 3d printers and the way the new 3d printing technology is going.  You will also get insights into the very lively and exciting world of commercial and non-commercial 3d printing artists, makers and communities.  At the end of the workshop you will send an object, that you choose from our âGreat Short Prints-Collectionâ, to print on one of our printers.",
